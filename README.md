# Machine-learning-with-iris-data-set
Building Machine Learning model using algorithms like Random Forrest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearestneighbors, K-Means Clustering, Decision Tree with Iris Dataset.  The simple Iris dataset for Multiclass Classification (required dataset for Hello World program in Machine Learning). It has data for three species (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica) of Iris flower. It contains 4 features as input (petallength, petal-width, sepallength and sepal_width) and label as output. It contains 150 rows, 50 rows for each species of Iris.
